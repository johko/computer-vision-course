On this page, you can find how to join the learners community, make a submission and get a certificate, and more details about the course!

## Assignment 📄

To obtain your certification for completing the course, complete the following assignments:

1. Training/fine-tuning a model
2. Building an application and hosting it on Hugging Face Spaces

### Training/fine-tuning a Model

There are notebooks under the Notebooks/Vision Transformers section. As of now, we have notebooks for object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. You can either train a model on a dataset that exists on 🤗 Hub or upload a dataset to a dataset repository and train a model on that.

The model repository needs to have the following:


1. A properly filled model card, you can check out [here for more information](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards).
2. If you trained a model with transformers and pushed it to Hub, the model card will be generated. In that case, edit the card and fill in more details.
3. Add the dataset’s ID to the model card to link the model repository to the dataset repository.

### Creating a Space

In this assignment section, you'll be building a Gradio-based application for your computer vision model and sharing it on 🤗 Spaces. Learn more about these tasks using the following resources:

- [Getting started with Gradio](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter9/1?fw=pt#introduction-to-gradio)
- [How to share your application on 🤗 Spaces](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter9/4?fw=pt)
