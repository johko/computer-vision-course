On this page, you can find how to join the learners community, make a submission and get a certificate, and more details about the course!

## Assignment ðŸ“„

To obtain your certification for completing the course, complete the following assignments:

1. Training/fine-tuning a model
2. Building an application and hosting it on Hugging Face Spaces

### Training/fine-tuning a Model

There are notebooks under the Notebooks/Vision Transformers section. As of now, we have notebooks for object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. You can either train a model on a dataset that exists on ðŸ¤— Hub or upload a dataset to a dataset repository and train a model on that.

The model repository needs to have the following:


1. A properly filled model card, you can check out [here for more information](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards).
2. If you trained a model with transformers and pushed it to Hub, the model card will be generated. In that case, edit the card and fill in more details.
3. Add the datasetâ€™s ID to the model card to link the model repository to the dataset repository.

### Creating a Space

In this assignment section, you'll be building a Gradio-based application for your computer vision model and sharing it on ðŸ¤— Spaces. Learn more about these tasks using the following resources:

- [Getting started with Gradio](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter9/1?fw=pt#introduction-to-gradio)
- [How to share your application on ðŸ¤— Spaces](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter9/4?fw=pt)
