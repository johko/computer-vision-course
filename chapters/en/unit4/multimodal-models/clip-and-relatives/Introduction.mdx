# CLIP and Relatives

So far we have learned about the fundamentals of multimodality with a special spotlight of Vision Language Models. This chapters provide a short overview of CLIP and similar models, highlighting their unique features and applicability to various machine learning tasks.
It sets the stage for a high-level exploration of key multimodal models that have emerged before and after CLIP, showcasing their significant contributions to the advancement of multimodal AI.

## Pre-CLIP

In this part, we explore the innovative attempts in multimodal AI before CLIP.
The focus is on influential papers that used deep learning to make significant strides in the field:

1. **"Multimodal Deep Learning" by Ngiam et al. (2011):** This paper demonstrated the use of deep learning for multimodal inputs, emphasizing the potential of neural networks in integrating different data types. It laid the groundwork for future innovations in multimodal AI.
