# A Brief History of 3D Vision

## 1838: Stereoscopy

- **Inventor**: Sir Charles Wheatstone.
- **Technique**: Presenting offset images to each eye through a stereoscope, creating depth perception.

## 1853: Anaglyph 3D

- **Pioneer**: Louis Ducos du Hauron
- **Method**: Using glasses with colored filters to separate images in complementary colors, creating a depth illusion.

## 1936: Polarized 3D

- **Developer**: Edwin H. Land.
- **Approach**: Utilizing polarized light technology in 3D movies, with glasses that filter light in specific directions.

## 1960s: Virtual Reality

- **Nature**: Experimental and not widely accessible.
- **Features**: Stereoscopic displays, head-tracking technology for immersive environments.

## 1979: Autostereograms (Magic Eye Images)

- **Creator**: Christopher Tyler
- **Concept**: 2D patterns that allow viewers to see 3D images without special glasses.

## 1986: IMAX 3D

- **Innovation**: Incorporating 3D technology in IMAX films using polarized glasses and dual projection systems.

## 2000s: Digital 3D Cinema

- **Evolution**: Digital projection systems, circular polarization, or active shutter glasses enhancing the 3D film experience.

## 2010s: 3D Television

- **Trend**: Introduction of 3D TVs with various technologies, like active shutter glasses and glasses-free autostereoscopic displays.
- **Decline**: Waning popularity due to glasses requirement, limited 3D content, and additional cost.

## 2010s: Virtual Reality Resurgence

- **Highlights**: Introduction of affordable, high-quality VR headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

## Ongoing Evolution

### Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR)

- **Development**: Blending digital content with the real world.

### Further VR Developments

- **Focus**: Enhancing quality, accessibility, and applicability in various sectors.
