## Community Powered
The result you have in front of you is as diverse as the community. A typical educational course is created by a small group of people, who try to match the tone of each other closely. We took a different road. While following a plan on which content we wanted to include, all authors had freedom in the choice of their style. Other members of the community reviewed the content and approved or made change suggestions.

The outcome is a truly unique course and proof of what a strong open-source community can achieve. 

If you want to **contribute** content or suggest some **typo/bug fixes**, head over to the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
